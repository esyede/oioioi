# Hello world!



I know this should be a classic welcome post but, there is few errors you need to solve before you sleep:


```python
import time

while True:
    time.sleep(1)
```


As [@someone](http://someone.site) said,

> Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.
> Therefore, if we write the code as cleverly as possible, we are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.
